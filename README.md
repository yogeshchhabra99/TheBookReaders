# TheBookReaders

##Description
This is a app where Readers can add the books the have read or want to read. Add reviews for books they read and their favourite lines from that book. This app will mail the user one of their favourite lines daily. There will be a BookExchange program too.

##Backend
The backend is built on Node.js. We use mongodb database. The reaspn for picking up a non relational database is that the objects have components that grow in size. Using relational database for this will have tables with a one one relations which is not efficient.

##FrontEnd 
The frontend is a progressive web app.
